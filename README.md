Real-Time Detection and Prediction of Epileptic Seizures using EEG Signals

This project is part of the IEEE EMBS Student Internship Program 2025. The aim is to develop an AI/ML-based system that detects and predicts epileptic seizures from EEG recordings, using real-world patient data from the CHB-MIT Scalp EEG Database.

---

##  Project Goals

- Develop a real-time seizure detection system using EEG data and machine learning.
- Focus on identifying seizure vs. non-seizure segments in EEG signals.
- Create an interactive dashboard using Power BI to visualize patient seizure data.
- Prepare a detailed report and a publishable research paper based on the project outcomes.

- ##  Technologies Used

- Python (Jupyter Notebooks)
- `mne`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `numpy`
- Power BI for data visualization
- VS Code for development environment

---

##  Project Progress

- [x] Dataset subset selected and downloaded
- [x] EDF files read using `mne`
- [x] EEG visualizations plotted for seizure segments
- [x] Converted seizure segments into CSV for Power BI use
- [ ] Power BI dashboard (in progress)
- [ ] Model training and evaluation
- [ ] Research paper and report drafting

---

##  Sample Visualization

- EEG signal with seizure segment highlighted
- Channel-wise waveform plots
- CSV export for use in dashboards

---

##  Deliverables

- Project Report
-  Working Prototype
-  Final Presentation
-  Publishable Research Paper
